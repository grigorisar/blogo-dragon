These instructions will get you a basic django backend server and a react frontend up and running.

## Installing 

Step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

#### Django Setup

To activate virtual enviroment enter the following command.
```
source ./backend/env/bin/activate
```
After activating the enviroment navigate the project directory.
```
cd ./backend/src

```
python -m manage.py createsuperuser
```
From here you can start the server and navigate to /admin or /api

```
python -m manage.py runserver

```
npm install
npm start
